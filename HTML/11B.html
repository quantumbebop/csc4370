"You need to distract it," you whisper to the boy, slowly standing up.
</p>
<p>
The boy glances at you incredulously. "What? How?"
</p>
<p>
"For fuck's sake, I don't know! Pretend to be a bone! Dog's like bones."
</p>
<p>
"I think this one would rather have meat!"
</p>
<p>
"Perfect." You say, booting the boy forward. He stumbles a few steps but then quickly rights himself and rushes to the side.
</p>
<p>
"Hey! Over here you-you stupid turd!"
</p>
<p>
"How insulting," you mutter. The dog seems to think so. It instantly leaps after the boy, who yelps and then begins to run.
</p>
<p>
"Kill it! Kill it, now!"
</p>
<p>
"Working on it!"
</p>
<p>
You jump up on top of a mountain of rubble and quickly make your way after the two. Carefully. A slip here could mean a broken ankle which would turn the both of you into literal dog food.
