You open your mouth to deliver a horrid lie, one that will teach the boy a lesson.
</p>
<p>
But then you catch a glimpse of his face, eyes sparkling so hopefully that the image is pitiful. And you can't bring yourself to do it.
</p>
<p>
"I saw an old road map," you lie, mentally switching tracks. "We're closer to Haven than I thought. Should be able to get there in less than a week if we hustle" 
</p>
<p>
The smile that suddenly blossoms on his face is almost worth the lie. Almost.
</p>
<p>
"Seriously?! That's... that's awesome!" He jumps and does an excited fist pump that nearly makes you chuckle. "I knew it! I knew we were making great time! And you said two weeks!"
</p>
<p>
"I said if we hustle," you grumble, rolling your eyes at his enthusiasum. But then you smirk at him. "Which means keeping pace with my pace. Think you can do that little man?"
</p>
<p>
"Of course!"
</p>
<p>
"I'll beleive it when I see it."
</p>
<p>
Yeah, this is totally going to come bite you back in the ass if he ever finds out. But eh. Not like things could get much worse.
