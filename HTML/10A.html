The boy instatnly grabs your hand.
</p>
<p>
"What was that?"
</p>
<p>
You don't answer, too busy concentrating on the slightest sounds. Maybe it was the wind again.
</p>
<p>
*Crack!*
</p>
<p>
*Hnnnnrgggrr*
</p>
<p>
That's not the wind.
</p>
<p>
"Run."
</p>
<p>
The boy barely has a second before you drag him through the rubble. No time to be gentle.Or subtle. Whatever made that noise is getting closer, if the patter of steps behind you is any indication.
</p>
<p>
Shit. Shitshitshit. Where to go?
</p>
<p>
"LOOK OUT!"
</p>
<p>
The split second warning is barely enough. You duck and something large passes over your head. But your momentum pushes you forward and you and the boy lose your balance and careen into the ground.
</p>
<p>
*Hngr! Grah! GRAH!*
</p>
<p>
You lift up your head. Before you is a dog. Or what was once a dog. Part of its right ear is missing, ripped to shreds by the look of it, and its fur is red, matted thick with dried blood and pus. But the look in its eyes, that dead, angry look. That's what gives it away. That and hole in its stomach where its entrails are leaking out of, like some sort of jump-rope.
</p>
<p>
The boy tugs on your sleeve. "Is- is it... infected?"
</p>
<p>
Before you can answer, the dog raises its head and lets out a hellish howl that sets your teeth on edge.
</p>
<p>
Shit.
</p>
