"Me?" You tilt your head back as you think of your answer. "Hmm. Good question. I guess if I had to narrow it down..."
</p>
<p>
"What? What?"
</p>
<p>
You shoot the boy an amused glance. "A pot roast dinner."
</p>
<p>
It's hillarious how fast the boy goes from eagerness to deadpan disbeleif. "Really."
</p>
<p>
"Really truly."
</p>
<p>
"How are you going to even get a pot roast dinner now. There are no restraunts."
</p>
<p>
"Well I guess I'll just have to make it the old fashioned way."
</p>
<p>
"How."
</p>
<p>
"Find a pig and stick into an oven."
</p>
<p>
"That's not how you make pot roast!"
</p>
<p>
"Yeah it is! That's how my dad made it!"
</p>
<p>
"Nuh uh."
</p>
<p>
"Uh huh!"
</p>
<p>
"Nuh uh!"
</p>
<p>
"Uh huh!"
</p>
<p>
"Nuh uh!"
</p>
<p>
"Okay, fine." You cross your arms. "How would your dad make it."
</p>
<p>
"I--!" The boy begins and then suddenly stops. "I..."
</p>
<p>
Sore subject, that's right. Shiiiit.
</p>
<p>
"I dunno." The boy looks down at the ground. "Mom used to do all the cooking. Dad wasn't allowed in the kitchen after he broke a-a skillet trying t-to make a s-sandwhich."
</p>
<p>
Shit. Is he crying? Shit. You don't do tears. At all.
</p>
<p>
"Hey..."
</p>
<p>
The boy suddenly looks up, eyes watering but his mouth is set in a hard line.
</p>
<p>
"They're still... you know..." A pained look crosses the boy's face. "Alive. And not... like them."
