<You body check the dog in the side, using the force of your shoulder to send both of you careening into the ground. The attack winds you but not the dog. It scrabbles to its feet and with a vicious growl, sinks its teeth right into your foot.
</p>
<p>
"AGHHH!" You smash the granite piece into its head. "FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! FUCKING DIE!"
</p>
<p>
The blow dazes the dog but it keeps its jaws locked onto your foot, shaking its head back and forth to rip it off. With a collossal effort, you lob the granite piece over its back. 
</p>
<p>
*Crunch*
</p>
<p>
The dog lets out a howl and finally lets go over your foot. You scrabble back as far as you can, away from the teeth and blood. 
</p>
<p>
Shit. It's only a matter of time before it free's itself. What the shit are you going to do then?
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, out of nowhere, there's a wild scream and the boy leaps off the rubble mountain, landing feet first on top of the dog's head.
</p>
<p>
There's an explosion of blood and gore. Some of it gets into your eyes. You can't help but think how fucking gross that is.
