The boy looks shaky and slightly nauseous. But his hand is steady enough as he helps you to your feet. 
</p>
<p>
"Are you okay?" 
</p>
<p>
You grimace. "I've been better."
</p>
<p>
He looks back to the dog. "Is it-?"
</p>
<p>
"Yeah." You say curtly, cutting him off. You hope he doesn't start to cry. You know the boy used to love dogs.
</p>
<p>
The boy sniffles onceand quickly wipes his eyes.
</p>
<p>
Good lad.
