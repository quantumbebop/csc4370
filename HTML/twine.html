You kick the rubble out of the way before turning to help the boy over the remains of what was a storage shack.

<p>
"Watch your step."
</p>
<p>
The boy nods and carefully navigates the rotting wood with a fleet footed expertise that can only come from experience.A stray peice jutting out of the floor snags onto his jeans and before he can stop, there's another rip in the tatters of his clothes.
</p>
<p>
"What did I just say?" You growl, knocking the boy on the head.
</p>
<p>
"Sorry."
</p>
<p>
You sigh. You'll have to scavenge something to replace the jeans. And maybe something for yourself. The rags you're wearing are barely keeping together as is.
</p>
<p>
The boy tugs on your sleeve. "I'm hungry."
</p>
<p>
You sigh again before bringing your backpack to the front.
