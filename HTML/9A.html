"I told you, I didn't see anything." You flick his head and nod to his backpack on the ground. "Now stop wasting time and let's go. We've screwed around long enough."
</p>
<p>
The boy gives you a sullen stare and you roll your eyes. Children. So fickle to please.
</p>
<p>
"Get a move on."
</p>
<p>
The boy crosses his arms and sits himself back down on the ground. "No. Not until you stop treating me like a kid."
</p>
<p>
Oh for the love of...
</p>
<p>
You squat down to his level and reach out to pat him on the head. The boy is one step ahead of you and he dodges to the side. You don't blame him, of course. You used to hate it when your older brother did the same thing to you.
</p>
<p>
"So you're not going to move until I stop treating you like a kid?"
</p>
<p>
"Yeah."
</p>
<p>
You smirk. "Oh, I get it. You were actually really scared, weren't you? That's why you didn't answer me when I called you."
</p>
<p>
"What? No I wasn't!" That gets the boys attention and he jumps up in an indignant way. "I told you, I didn't hear you!"
</p>
<p>
"Suuuuuure. Whatever you say, champ."
</p>
<p>
"I wasn't!" He stamps his foot and then throws his hands up in exasperation. "Forget it. This is stupid." He says, walking away.
</p>
<p>
You hide your smirk behind your hand. Another thing you hated about your brother was how easily he could goad you into doing things you didn't want to.
</p>
<p>
Hook, line and sinker
