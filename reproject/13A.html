		The boy looks shaky and slightly nauseous. But his hand is steady enough as he helps you to your feet. 
		</p>

		<p>
		"I couldn't leave you behind," is his explanation and you're grateful for his honesty. His eyes dart to your foot and you grimace.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Is it-?"

		<p>
		"Yeah." You say curtly, cutting him off. Already, you can feel the blood pooling in the shoe and your head starts to feel woozy. You could cry if you had any tears left to give a shit.

		The boy looks about ready to cry but when you turn to him, he sniffles once and quickly wipes his eyes.

		<p>
		Good lad.
