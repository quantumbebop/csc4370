		You offer the boy a pebble and he accepts it without complaint. He pops it into his mouth and morosely moves it around in his cheeks.

		<p>
		World's worst rock candy. Literally.

		<p>
		"How many more days?" He asks, through bits of wood.
		</p>

		<p>
		You do a quick mental calculation. The outbreak started three months ago, you and the boy have been on the road for two and a half...
		</p>

		<p>
		You grimace. It'll take at least another two weeks.That's an optimistic evaluation. The rate the two of you are going, with all the stops and mishaps, it'll take you at least two before you reach Haven. But the boy doesn't need to know that.
