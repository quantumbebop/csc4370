		The boy runs himself into a dead end and the dog slowly advances on its prey, snarling madly. The boy looks about ready to shit his pants.
		</p>

		<p>
		"HELP!!"
		</p>

		<p>
		With a yell, you leap off the mountain of rubble and bring the granite piece down on top of the dog's head. There's a sickening *crack!* and a surprised whimper from the dog.
		</p>

		<p>
		You roll off to the side and look up. The dog is still standing though it's definitely looking dazed. Part of its eye is dangling by the retina. The other eye is fixed solely on you with hate and bloodlust.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Kill it!"
		</p>

		<p>
		You don't have to be told twice. Before it can recover, you kick out with your boot and catch it squarely in the jaw. It snarls back at you but before it can leap, you drop the granite piece on top of its spine, effectively pinning it down.
		</p>

		<p>
		The thing howls bloody murder but the sound suddenly cuts off as the boy jumps up and curb stomps its skull.
