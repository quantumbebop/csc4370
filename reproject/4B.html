		"Me?" You tilt your head back as you think of your answer. "Hmm. Good question. I guess if I had to narrow it down..."
		</p>
		
		<p>
		"What? What?"
		</p>

		<p>
		You shoot the boy an amused glance. "A pot roast dinner."
		</p>

		<p>
		It's hilarious how fast the boy goes from eagerness to deadpan disbelief. "Really."
		</p>

		<p>
		"Really truly."
		</p>

		<p>
		"How are you going to even get a pot roast dinner now. There are no restaurants."
		</p>

		<p>
		"Well I guess I'll just have to make it the old fashioned way."
		</p>

		<p>
		"How."
		</p>

		<p>
		"Find a pig and stick into an oven."
		</p>

		<p>
		"That's not how you make pot roast!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"Yeah it is! That's how my dad made it!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"Nuh uh."
		</p>

		<p>
		"Uh huh!"
		</p>
		<p>
		"Nuh uh!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"Uh huh!"
		</p>
		
		<p>
		"Nuh uh!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"Okay, fine." You cross your arms. "How would your dad make it."
		</p>

		<p>
		"I--!" The boy begins and then suddenly stops. "I..."
		</p>

		<p>
		Sore subject, that's right. Shiiiit.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		"I dunno." The boy looks down at the ground. "Mom used to do all the cooking. Dad wasn't allowed in the kitchen after he broke a-a skillet trying t-to make a s-sandwich."
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Shit. Is he crying? Shit. You don't do tears. At all.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Hey..."
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The boy suddenly looks up, eyes watering but his mouth is set in a hard line.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		"They're still... you know..." A pained look crosses the boy's face. "Alive. And not... like them."
