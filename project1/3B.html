		The boy's eyes light up, practically illuminating his face through all the grime.

		<p>
		"Really?"

		"Of course." You reach out and ruffle his head a bit. He scowls, ducking out of the way but it quickly gives way to a small smile as you say, "Would I ever lie to you."
		</p>

		<p>
		"No."
		</p>

		<p>
		"Then there you have it."
