		You kick the rubble out of the way before turning to help the boy over the remains of what was a storage shack.

		"Watch your step."
		</p>

		<p>
		The boy nods and carefully navigates the rotting wood with a fleet footed expertise that can only come from experience. A stray piece jutting out of the floor snags onto his jeans and before he can stop, there's another rip in the tatters of his clothes.
		</p>

		<p>
		"What did I just say?" You growl, knocking the boy on the head.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Sorry."
		</p>

		<p>
		You sigh. You'll have to scavenge something to replace the jeans. And maybe something for yourself. The rags you're wearing are barely keeping together as is.
		</p>

		<p>
		The boy tugs on your sleeve. "I'm hungry."
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You sigh again before bringing your backpack to the front.
