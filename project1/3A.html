		The light in boy's eyes dims and he lowers his head.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Oh."
		</p>
	
		<p>
		That's all he says but it's enough to make you want to kick yourself. Good going, jerk.

		"C'mon." You gently nudge him forward. "We have to keep going."
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The two of you continue to walk, the silence thick and uncomfortable between you and him.
		</p>

		The boy has a frown on his face. You can tell he's thinking hard about something by the way his brows furrow.

		<p>
		"What's the first thing you're going to do when we reach Haven?" He asks after a moment of silence.
