		"You need to distract it," you whisper to the boy, slowly standing up.
		</p>

		<p>
		The boy glances at you incredulously. "What? How?"
		</p>

		<p>
		"For fuck's sake, I don't know! Pretend to be a bone! Dogs like bones."
		</p>

		<p>
		"I think this one would rather have meat!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"Perfect." You say, booting the boy forward. He stumbles a few steps but then quickly rights himself and rushes to the side.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Hey! Over here you-you stupid turd!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"How insulting," you mutter. The dog seems to think so. It instantly leaps after the boy, who yelps and then begins to run.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Kill it! Kill it, now!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"Working on it!"
		</p>

		<p>
		You jump up on top of a mountain of rubble and quickly make your way after the two. Carefully. A slip here could mean a broken ankle which would turn the both of you into literal dog food.
