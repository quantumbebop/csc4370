		You let out a relieved sigh and decide to let the boy off the hook. Getting angry now is pointless. No harm, no foul.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Just the wind" you say, coming closer to the boy. Your heart is still going a mile a minute so your voice comes out a little more shaky than you'd like. The boy seems to notice if the way his eyes narrow is anything to go by.
		</p>

		<p>
		"You saw something didn't you."
		</p>

		<p>
		"What? No, I didn't. There was nothing."
		</p>

		<p>
		The boy stamps his feet. "I'm not a child! I can handle whatever it is!"
		</p>

		<p>
		You sigh again. Maybe you should just make something up to get the boy off your back. But then again, making up a situation just for a few moment's peace sounds rather petty. But goddamn if you can't deal with this adolescent bullshit right now.
