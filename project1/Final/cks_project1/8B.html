		You grab the boy by his rags and roughly pull him in. He lets out an indignant yelp at the headlock you put him in.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Ow! Quit it!"
		</p>

		<p>
		You tighten your grip. "What did I say was the first rule when I call out to you?!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"But I-!"
		</p>

		<p>
		"First rule!"
		</p>

		<p>
		The boy breaks out of your grip and scowls. "Respond instantly. But I didn't hear you! It's not my fault!"
		</p>

		<p>
		You look carefully into the boy's eyes. He seems to be telling the truth and shit, you're too tired to deal with this adolescent bullshit so you let him off the hook. For now.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Get your ears checked," you grumble, bending down to pick up your backpack.
		</p>

		<p>
		The boy's scowl deepens but he stays quiet, rubbing at the back of his neck. You notice a bruise starting to form and part of you feels a little ashamed at how badly you lashed out.
		</p>

		<p>
		The other part is still pissed off.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Did you see anything out there?" he asks after a silent minute
		</p>

		<p>
		You open your mouth to reply negative before pausing. You could tell him the truth and say there was nothing. Or you could teach him a lesson for not responding and make something up.
